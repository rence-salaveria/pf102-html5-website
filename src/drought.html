                <h3>Droughts in USA</h3>
                <p class="wrap-word">
                    In the United States, drought is the second-most costly form of natural disaster (behind
                    hurricanes),
                    exacting an average toll of $9.6 billion in damage and loss per event. Meanwhile, some level of
                    drought often has some part of the country in its grip. During the historic dry spell of 2012
                    (the nation’s most extensive since the 1930s), as much as two-thirds of the country was affected by
                    drought at its peak. U.S. droughts can be persistent as well. From 2012 to 2016, scant rainfall and
                    record-breaking heat in California created what is estimated to have been the state’s worst drought
                    in 1,200 years.

                <h3>Water Demand and its Effects</h3>
                <p class="wrap-word">
                    Drought often reflects an imbalance in water supply and demand. Regional population booms and
                    intensive agricultural water use can put a strain on water resources, even tipping the scale enough
                    to make the threat of drought a reality. One study estimates that from 1960 to 2010, the human
                    consumption of water increased the frequency of drought in North America by 25 percent.
                    What’s more, once rainfall dwindles and drought conditions take hold, persistent water demand—in
                    the form of increased pumping from groundwater, rivers, and reservoirs—can deplete valuable water
                    resources that may take years to replenish and permanently impact future water availability.
                    Meanwhile, demand for water supplied by upstream lakes and rivers, particularly in the form of
                    irrigation and hydroelectric dams, can lead to the diminishing or drying out of downstream water
                    sources, which may contribute to drought in other regions.
