                <h3>What is Sea Level?</h3>
                <p class="wrap-word">
                    Sea level is the base level for measuring elevation and depth on Earth.

                    Because the ocean is one continuous body of water, its surface tends to seek the same level
                    throughout the world. However, winds, currents, river discharges, and variations in gravity and
                    temperature prevent the sea surface from being truly level.

                    So that the surface of the ocean can be used as a base for measuring elevations, the concept of
                    "local mean sea level" has been developed. In the United States and its territories, local mean sea
                    level is determined by taking hourly measurements of sea levels over a period of 19 years at various
                    locations, and then averaging all the measurements.

                <h3>Causes of Sea Level Rise</h3>
                <p class="wrap-word">
                    On reexamining each of the known contributors to sea level rise from 1900 to 2018, the research,
                    led by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, uses improved estimates and applies
                    satellite data to better understand historic measurements.
                    <br>
                    The researchers found that estimates of global sea level variations based on tide-gauge observations
                    had slightly overestimated global sea levels before the 1970s. (Located at coastal stations
                    scattered around the globe, tide gauges are used to measure sea level height.) They also found
                    that mountain glacier meltwater was adding more water to the oceans than previously realized but
                    that the relative contribution of glaciers to sea level rise is slowly decreasing. And they
                    discovered that glacier and Greenland ice sheet mass loss explain the increased rate of sea level
                    rise before 1940.
