                <h3>Tips for Heat Waves</h3>
                <p class="wrap-word">
                    Properly install window air conditioners, sealing any cracks and insulating if necessary.
                    Check A/C ducts for proper insulation and clean filters.
                    Install awnings, blinds, or light-colored drapes and keep them closed to keep sunlight and heat out.
                    Upgrade your windows and weather-strip doors to keep heat out and cool air in.
                    Make sure your first aid kit is updated and get trained in first aid relief.
                    Have a plan for wherever you (and your family members/pets) spend time during a heat wave—home,
                    work, and school—and prepare for power outages. Discuss heat safety precautions with members of your
                    household.
                    Check the contents of your emergency disaster kit in case a power outage occurs.
                    Be aware of weather forecasts and the upcoming temperature changes.
                    It’s not just the high temperature. The heat index is the temperature the body feels when the
                    effects of heat and humidity are combined. See our heat index chart.
                    A backhome home generator is the safest and most reliable solution! Power outages are common during
                    heatwaves because the need for A/C puts too much pressure on the power grids. A standby generator,
                    however, automatically keeps the A/C running, the lights on, food and medicine from spoiling, and
                    medical devices operating.

                <h3>Droughts in Africa</h3>
                <p class="wrap-word">
                    Coordinated reporting is lacking and, at the global level, research and tracking of the impacts of
                    climate change are biased toward developed countries, scientists concluded in a new study published
                    Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change.
                    <br>
                    Africa is warming faster than the global average, and the lack of data is a roadblock to effective
                    disaster preparation, assessment of vulnerability and planning for climate resilience, said
                    co-author Friederike Otto, acting director of the University of Oxford Environmental Change
                    Institute. She said she noticed the information gap when she reviewed the international disasters
                    database (EM-DAT), for another recent study on extreme weather events in lower income countries.
                    <br>
                    During the review, Otto said, she thought to herself, “This is strange. There are no heat waves in
                    Africa. This can’t be right. Parts of Africa are hotspots, why are they not in these databases? If
                    there are no records of the extreme heat events, and when we completely ignore the impacts, it will
                    be impossible to adapt adequately.”
                    <br>
                    Co-author Luke Harrington, also with the Environmental Change Institute, said observations from
                    weather stations and climate models show intensifying heat waves in Sub-Saharan Africa. “But these
                    heat waves are not being recorded,” he said. “It’s as if they haven’t happened, but we know they
                    have.”
